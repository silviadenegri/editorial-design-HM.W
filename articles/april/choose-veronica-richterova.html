                    Veronkia Ritchterová is a Czech visual artist who deforms plastic bottles with heat and makes sculptures. Since 2004 she has used thousands of bottles to create hundreds of objects, that Ritchterová calls PET-ART sculptures. Her cartoonish and nature-inspired style demonstrates how we can all find beauty in garbage. 
                    " Life in plastic, is fantastic " sang the Aqua in the now distant 1997. But our life, now too invaded by plastic, is anything but fantastic also according to the many reports that denounce the presence of plastic even in the rain and in the snow. If plastic is scary in our real world, it's magic in Veronika Richterová 's .
                    Artist from the Czech Republic, born in 1964, has been using polyethylene terephthalate, better known by the acronym PET, since 2004 to create amazing plastic sculptures. 
                    In his recreating the most disparate forms of life, including crocodiles, bats, mushrooms and flowers, he creates suggestive sculptures starting from common plastic bottles thanks to the ability of PET to be easily malleable when exposed to heat.
                    His creations appear to us in natural forms known to us but translucent and luminous, recognizable but with those elements such as the corks, characteristic of the bottles, which are alienating and almost out of place. The result is incredible scenarios suspended between reality and dream.
                    His design products are also dreamy, candlesticks and lamps made with the same principle, using PET instead of glass and LED bulbs to avoid generating too much heat. Of various shapes, they are inspired both by the shapes of the classic chandeliers, and in a more creative way by those of the bottles, simply altering the original shape less.
                    PET-ART , this is the name chosen by Veronika for this art, is for the artist herself exploration and experimentation, given the unpredictable deformations that plastic can assume but also the enormous abundance of shapes and colors in which this material is here I'm. Precisely for the enormous variety of this, Richterová together with the graphic designer and husband Michal Cihlář, launched the PET-ART Museum , a collection of plastic bottles that has more than 3000 pieces coming from more than 70 countries.
                    Very attentive to recycling and expert in the reuse of waste, she also works with leather waste, from which she obtains curious masks, while with the name of NO-MAD-DESIGN she creates designs and do-it-yourself solutions with practically no cost for situations. extreme, like refugee camps.
