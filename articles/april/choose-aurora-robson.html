                <p class="text-article">
                    Aurora Robson is a multi-media artist known predominantly for her meditative work intercepting the plastic waste stream. Her practice is about subjugating negativity and shifting trajectories. Her work is a formal meditation on recurring nightmares she had as a child which she hybridizes with forms found in nature. Robson was born in Toronto in 1972 and grew up in Hawaii. She lived and worked in New York City for over 2 decades during which time she studied art history and visual arts at Columbia University. Recently, Robson moved to the Hudson Valley to raise her two daughters with her husband Marshall Coles.
                    Aurora Robson is a recipient of the Pollock-Krasner Grant, a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Sculpture, a TED/Lincoln Re-Imagine Prize and a National Endowment for the Arts Art Work Grant. She has exhibited her work internationally in museums, galleries and non-traditional spaces since 2002.
                    Robson is also the founding artist of Project Vortex, an international collective of artists, designers and architects who also work in innovative ways with plastic debris. Robson is passionate about developing integrative methods for artists and designers to utilize plastic debris as a raw material. Since 2014, Robson has been developing and assisting with the implementation of a course called Sculpture + Intercepting the Waste Stream designed to foster creative stewardship through academia at colleges, universities and high schools around the world.  Aurora Robson is a Canadian American artist who creates sculptures, paintings, and collages from plastic debris that focus on environmental themes. By intercepting the waste stream, Robertson repurposes household and industrial plastics while bringing awareness to plastic pollution. In 2008 she founded a non-profit called Project Vortex that supports other reuse artists and encourages the cleanups of waterways. 
                    We are an international collective of artists, designers, and architects actively focusing on the global problem of plastic pollution through our work. Operating at the intersection of art and science, we strive to inspire people to rethink and reinvent plastic debris through innovation, creative stewardship, and education. We are dedicated to improving global understanding of the impacts of plastic consumption + pollution. We support and assist with the development of initiatives to restrict the flow of plastic debris to the oceans. 
                    created this piece in an engagement sponsored by the Waimea Ocean Film Festival and the Sculpt the Future Foundation. Kamilo is made from 100% plastic marine debris cleaned up from the southern tip of Hawaii by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. No hardware or paint was used in the creation of this sculpture. Artist Aurora Robson has spent the last two decades turning trash into treasure, quite literally: Her multidisciplinary practice intercepts waste streams, transforming plastic debris into abstract sculptures and large-scale installations that meditate on the state of the environment.
                    She is also the founder of Project Vortex, an international collective of artists and designers focused on raising awareness around plastic pollution, shifting its trajectory, and broadening the cultural landscape through their work.
                    She says, The thing that scares me the most about plastic is how insidious it is, and how people trust it. They don’t know the chemical compositions. They don’t know how we all have phthalates in our systems—how we all have these chemicals footprints now, from plastics.
                    Scientists are finding microfibers in the air we breathe. And the long-term effects of this—I mean, you don’t have to be a scientist to know that’s not good. To have it in the food chain is not good; to have it in embryonic fluid is not good; to have it basically in every living [organism]—even in cellulose in plants, they’re finding trace chemicals from plastics.
                    There’s all kinds of waste problems, but plastic is its own animal—it’s in its own category of destructiveness. So that’s been my focus. [I wanted to] see if I could do the same thing [as I did in my paintings]—but with this global nightmare, instead of just with my personal nightmare.
                    I really just responded to it initially from a strictly conceptual angle. I was interested in the familiar aspect of it, as a material. You know, people think of it as disposable, but it’s exactly the opposite. I felt it was odd that it wasn’t being explored in contemporary art in New York City—I saw nothing in the galleries or museums. It was exclusively on the street.
                    And so I thought, well, that’s weird, because the best art, in my opinion, has always been [made from] realia—you’re reflecting a shared reality and trying to filter it through your consciousness and present it in a way that can support dialogue or reflection or engagement.
                    I love plastic debris for art and design, and what you can do with it. I’ve been ultrasonic welding it, I’ve been injection welding it, I’ve been riveting it, I’ve been threading it, I’ve been sewing it.
                    I’ve been compulsively exploring the material to see if there are ways I can develop it for not just my own studio practice, but in a way that would also be adaptable for other people to utilize this material, and keep it out of the highly dysfunctional recycling process. Only really about nine percent of plastic, globally, actually gets recycled.
