                    Inequality is an inherent feature of the world that we live in. You must have come across rhetorics about the rich getting even richer, and the poor getting even poorer. In the face of this divide, food waste is a huge problem. However, the major proponent of this problem is the upper-class of our society. A study states that we throw out almost 1.3 billion tonnes every year. Since the rich frequently throw away food to buy fresher produce, this number is only expected to go higher. To tackle this predicament, a campaign by Hellmann’s called The Art We Waste presented an interesting spin on this phenomenon.
                    This video campaign prepared by Miami Ad School presented the contrasting idea that the rich spend exorbitant amounts of money on buying art, and yet fail to understand the severity of the food wastage crisis. A gallery exhibition showcasing the work of renowned artists made the campaign even more impactful. But, the caveat was that all the art pieces displayed at the exhibition had one striking feature. The artists used paint derived by turning food waste into color for the creation of all the artworks on display. The audience at the gallery was later allowed to place bids for the artworks. However, the materials used in the making of the artworks were unbeknownst to them. By the end of the exhibition, the audience was made privy to this secret. Their reaction at the end painted a clear picture of the campaign’s effectiveness. We feel that The Art We Waste made judicious of the understanding of human psychology to deliver its message. Given the urgency that resides over the need to tackle food waste, we need such campaigns to advocate for the cause.
