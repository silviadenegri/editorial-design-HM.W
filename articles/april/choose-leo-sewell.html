                    Leo Sewell grew up near a dump. He has played with junk now for fifty years and has developed his own assemblage technique. His works are collected by corporations, museums and individuals throughout the world. Leo continues to cull the refuse of Philadelphia out of which he fashions pieces of all sizes, from a lifesize housecat to a 40 foot installation.
                    His sculptures are composed of recognizable objects of plastic, metal and wood. These objects are chosen for their color, shape, texture, durability and patina; then they are assembled using nails, bolts, and screws. The outdoor sculptures are constructed of stainless steel, brass, or aluminum found objects which are welded together.
                    Leo Sewell does work by commission. He can also use objects from the patron's past for a more personal assemblage.
                    Leo Sewell is an American “found object” artist who uses recycled material to make sculptures of plastic, metal, and wood. From growing up near a dump, Sewell has been playing with junk for fifty years and has developed his own assemblage technique. Leo’s work can be found in over forty museums and private collections and has also been featured on the children’s show Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood. His art prominently features animals and follows naturalistic themes. 
                    Over the years, Sewell organized five exhibitions in the Arts League’s gallery, the most noted of these exhibitions was the “Penis Show” in early 1994. This exhibition, billed as “the male member as a subject in sculpture, drawing, photography and ready-mades”, gained national and local attention. The “Penis Show” consisted of photographs of found phallic objects and several artworks that artists had quietly made in their studios but never before exhibited in galleries. The piece showcased in this year’s auction is from this exhibition and will include a reception and private tour of the artist’s studio for the winning bidder and up to 6 guests.
                    Leo Sewell is a locally-based “found-object” artist whose fanciful sculptures composed of “junk” have garnered national attention. His works are collected by corporations, museums and individuals throughout the world. Sewell’s art follows naturalistic themes, and animals feature prominently in his creations. His collage-like sculpture is assembled from metal, wood, and plastic that he collects from trash, yard sales, and flea markets. For some commissions, he uses objects, often of sentimental value or with personal meaning, contributed by the patron who has commissioned the art.
                    Sewell has produced over 4,000 works over the last 50 years. His art has been seen on children’s television shows, including Captain Noah and Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood, and features in the permanent collections of 23 Ripley’s Believe It or Not! museums worldwide, as well as in museums such as the American Visionary Art Museum (Baltimore, Maryland), the Chicago Children’s Museum (Chicago, IL), the Garbage Museum (Stratford, CT), the Museo de Sera International (Madrid, Spain), the Please Touch Museum (Philadelphia, PA), and the Shonandai Cultural Center (Fujisawa, Japan). His work is also collected by corporations including NBC and Nike, Inc, and Sewell has produced public art works for institutions, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and local state environmental protection offices.
