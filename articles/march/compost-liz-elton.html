                    Liz Elton begins with landscape and still-life painting in order to explore the potential of waste and the recycling of matter.  Her works embrace their own ephemerality whilst addressing environmental issues such as the connection between soil health and food waste and shifts in ecological thinking.  Much of her work is made on compostable cornstarch (the material used for food waste recycling bags) and coloured with vegetable dyes from kitchen waste intercepted on its way to compost.  She often embeds seeds of vegetables and medicinal plants in her work, and in 2020 lockdown began a series of limited edition prints of images of her compost bin referencing historical still-life painting.  Liz has a BA in Fine Art (Painting) from Wimbledon College of Art, and an MA in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Art and Design.  She is the recipient of a Mark Rothko Memorial Trust Artist in Residence Award, Daugavpils, Latvia, has been shortlisted for the John Moores Painting Prize three times and her work was awarded special commendation in Dentons Art Prize 2018.  Her installations, paintings and photographs have been shown widely, and her work is included in corporate and private collections in the UK and internationally.  
                    ‘Harvest’, Vegetable Dyes from Food Waste and Food Colouring on Compostable Cornstarch Food Recycling Bag Material, with Silk, St Saviour’s, Highbury, 2018
                    Liz Elton is an artist who makes work on compostable cornstarch, the material used to make food waste recycling bags, to think about our relationship with landscape, time passing, and the potential embedded in waste. This material is made from crops such as corn or potatoes, and she uses it not just because of its connections to land use, food and waste, but also because it is fragile and ethereal and floats like parachute silk with the movement of the air around it, which can be quite meditative to watch (links to videos of installed works are at the end of this post).
                    Recent works 'One Hundred Harvests' and ‘Harvest’, refer to research discussing how intensive agricultural methods have compromised the fertility of our soil so that it may only support a further one hundred harvests. Similar works look at landscape related themes further using vegetable dyes from food waste and food colouring as well as watercolours, earth pigments, food supplements, seeds and grains.
                    ‘Hill’, Vegetable Dyes from Food Waste, Food Colouring, Water Miscible Oil, Silk, Cornstarch, Seeds from Native Medicinal Plants, shown in Yield at 163 Gallery 2019
                    ‘Hill’ was shown in ‘Yield’ at 163 Gallery in Herne Hill in 2019 and was inspired by the bicentennial of the birth of Victorian art critic John Ruskin who lived in the Herne Hill area for over 40 years. Starting with a Google Earth image looking down on the many houses and gardens of Herne Hill, Liz constructed ‘Hill’ using compostable cornstarch food recycling bags coloured with vegetable dyes, food colouring and food supplements sewn together with silk, and impregnated the work with the seeds of native plants with medicinal qualities such as chamomile, yarrow and feverfew.
                    Lockdown meant that Liz thought about her practice in a more intimate way, rooted in cooking, growing vegetables, making compost, giving plants away. She started a lockdown diary, photographing kitchen waste on its way to the compost bin - onion skins from a rescue box bought when the local market re-opened, flowers brought back from a funeral when they couldn’t be given away. There are twelve images in the diary at the moment, and they will continue to be added to.
