                    Olafur Eliasson uses technical devices and natural elements such as light, water, and fog to transform exhibition spaces into immersive, site-specific environments. Major themes include human perception and our relationship to the natural world. For his major 2003 commission The Weather Project, Eliasson installed a giant artificial sun inside Tate Modern. For Ice Watch (2014), he left giant blocks of glacial ice to melt in London, Paris, and Copenhagen. Both spectacular projects aimed to raise awareness about climate change. In other works, Eliasson has embraced optical illusions. He has been the subject of exhibitions at Fondation Louis Vuitton, Moderna Museet, Tate Modern, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, among other institutions. In 2003, Eliasson represented Denmark at the Venice Biennale.
                    To celebrate this year’s Earth Day, renowned conceptual artist Olafur Eliasson is launching a new artwork that will guide us away from our narrow, human-centric view of our planet. Titled Earth Perspectives, the participatory work reenvisions human constructs like maps, the globe, and space by including the perspectives of plants, animals, and other natural elements. “On Earth Day,” said Eliasson in a press release, “I want to advocate—as on any other day—that we recognise these various perspectives and, together, celebrate their coexistence.” 
                    Earth Perspectives is far from Eliasson’s first foray into climate activism. His presentation at the 2019 United Nations Climate Action Summit powerfully demonstrated art’s ability to provoke emotional, visceral responses to climate change—something that data points and statistics often struggle to do. To illustrate the importance of firsthand experience when creating awareness and impact, he began by explaining his 2014 installation Ice Watch. The piece saw the Danish-Icelandic artist and a team of geologists transport 12 blocks of melting glacial ice to Paris’s Climate Change Conference. “To take all the data, news, and scientific papers and turn it into something you can touch is, I think, incredibly effective,” he said.
                    Ice Watch, which most recently traveled to London in 2018, is a continuation of Eliasson’s lifelong belief that art creates spaces for us to engage in both individual and collective experiences. Last year, he was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for climate action by the United Nations Development Programme. In his new role, Eliasson is committed to continuing his advocacy for urgent climate action. 
                    In addition to his creative practice, Eliasson also founded a solar energy company called Little Sun with engineer Frederik Ottesen in 2012. Their mission is to displace fossil fuel lighting in communities living without electricity and to raise awareness of energy access and climate action.
