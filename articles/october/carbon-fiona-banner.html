                    The artist is working with Greenpeace UK to send a clear message to Environment Secretary George Eustice and highlight the Government’s failure to protect Britain’s most sensitive marine areas. This sculpture, Klang, is one of a series of three, the remaining two Full Stop sculptures will be deployed as an installation at sea in the Dogger Bank protected area. The art action completes the placing of granite boulders by Greenpeace UK inside the Dogger Bank marine protected area in the North Sea to ensure bottom trawlers can no longer operate in the new bottom trawler exclusion zone.
                    “I wanted to deploy my sculptures as agents for change because the rhetoric coming from our government was duplicitous. To use a full stop to call that out, to put it in front of Defra [the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], which is in the same building as the Home Office, felt appropriate. To some extent, there has been a shift in my practice in terms of addressing the environment. But I’ve always thought about our strange and violent relationship with nature. It’s just now the science is out in front of us all. But although we were all incredibly bad at responding to science, what we can respond to is imagery, to things in front of us. Recently, I have been using my work to create those powerful images. "We need to change our relationship with the environment and we need to take more responsibility. That’s why I’m continuing to make work where I’m thinking about our complicated relationship with nature—something we revere and celebrate and, at the same time, abuse and manipulate and use as a resource in the most brutal of ways. It’s right there in front of us: the headlights are on and either we’re blinded by it or we try to respond to it.”
                    These works are materially different in that they have been painted with sustainably sourced squid ink. “We can’t put anything in the water that is toxic,” Banner said, “but they do smell a bit fishy. I was in the house the other day saying what’s that smell, what’s been going on and eventually it was traced back to me.” A Defra spokesperson said: “We are putting sustainable fishing and protection of our seas at the heart of our future fishing strategy. We have already set up a ‘Blue Belt’ of protected waters nearly twice the size of England and the Fisheries Bill proposes new powers to better manage and control our Marine Protected Areas and English waters
