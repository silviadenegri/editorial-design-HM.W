                <p class="text-article">
                    Leading figure of street art and anti-establishment movements, Banksy has engaged with several social issues: peace, world hunger, and of course environmentalism. Across his works, the British artist often uses images of animals, such as rats or monkeys, personifying them with human behaviors. Several graffitis have addressed the environment directly by prominently featuring bears, rats or kids.
                    Banksy is the British graffiti artist considered one of the greatest exponents of street art. His works, eccentric and incisive, allow the viewer to reflect on the system and society we live in; they are a symbol of struggle and protest in a world where economic interests often prevail over what should be the good for the community.
                    The aura of mystery that, by choice and by necessity, feeds itself when talking about the figure of Banksy, makes him a real myth of our times. His visual protest involves a vast and heterogeneous audience and makes him one of the most loved artists by the younger generations.
                    WThe artist does not authorize exhibitions dedicated to his works, but he does not forbid them. Banksy encourages everyone who wants to reinterpret his  work and makes it travel around. According to him, art must belong to everyone. The messages must reach everyone.
                    His critique of pop-cultural imagery, politics and even art and museums was seen by some as a mere revolt and it was interpreted as ingenious by many others.
                    Much of his work is aimed at informing and sharing issues that have little popular attention. One of the main issues is the environment, and Banksy uses street art as a mobilizing tool to inform (even those who may not want to be informed).
                    Beside drawing about political issues, he draws about environmental issues. One of the well-known graffiti of Banksy is the second picture, the ‘gasbird’. Due to most artists, this graffiti symbolizes the death of species due to the gas spills and the use of gases. As you can see most of the drawings are made in order to raise awareness and show what is harmful, which we do as ‘usual things’. In most of his drawings he tries to make people think about the issues he is talking about.
                    As we look at these photos of graffiti, we need to get up and do something.There are so many graffiti that we can talk and discuss here, but actions speak louder than words.   
                    Banksy has always been overtly political and controversial, but this was a clear environmental message in an area which is home to one of the largest steelworks in Europe. The image was displayed in the news and on social media across the globe.
                    Through his use of a child, Banksy’s piece echoes the work of another street artist, Ernest Zacharevic, who reached international fame in 2012 with his two street murals little children on a bike and kid on a motorcycle located in the city of George Town, Malaysia.
                    Though Banksy’s identity was well guarded, he came to notice as a freehand graffiti artist in 1993. 
                    Using stencils since 2000 to enhance his speed, he developed a distinctive iconography of highly recognizable images, such as rats and policemen, that communicated his antiauthoritarian message. With wry wit and stealth, Banksy merged graffiti art with installation and performance. 
                    In the 2003 exhibition “Turf War,” he painted on the bodies of live pigs. At his “Crude Oils” exhibition in London in 2005, which featured altered replicas of the works of Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Edward Hopper, he released 200 live rats in the gallery. 
                    Stencils make it easier for Banksy to paint his works, likely because they are quicker to create. The French graffiti artist Blek le Rat influenced him during his early days. It is believed that Blek le Rat is the godfather of stencil graffiti, and they are often confused with each other.
                    An antiwar, philanthropic and revolutionary, he uses his art to express his dissatisfaction with certain aspects of society, certain political situations, or even certain decisions taken by world leaders through his art.
                    Banksy began producing street art in his hometown of Bristol during the early 1990s. He started working with spray paint on trains, before moving to public places around the city. Throughout his career, he has chosen to work with stencils, creating his own and using spray paint to place them on walls. His art usually features striking and humorous images, poignant slogans, and is more often than not imbued with political, social, and cultural meaning. 
                    As “street art” and “graffiti” are associated with criminal damage in many places, such as the UK, he chose the name Banksy to remain anonymous. The name appeared more and more next to graffiti popping up around Bristol. As he gained more attention and recognition, from the early 2000s his work started to appear in other cities around the UK as well as other parts of the world.
