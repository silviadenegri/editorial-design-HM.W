                    Nick Gentry is a London-based artist whose signature device is to recycle used floppy discs (the ancestor of the USB drive), on which he paints astonishingly futuristic portraits. His work is influenced by the development of consumerism, technology and cyber culture in our society. Gentry also uses used film rolls, VHS disks, and x-rays, which he skillfully integrates into his portraits.In the work of Nick Gentry the critique of consumerism, especially from the technological standpoint, represents the focal agenda. Therefore, the artist employs recycling as a starting working method in order to construct his peculiar compositions. A conversation between digital and analog processes, as well as the topics of identity and cyber culture, seems to be the central themes around which Gentry lead the general narrative behind his work. As a matter of fact, the haunting and eerie images are raising serious philosophical questions about the meaning of (human) life in the digital era where the distance between the man and the machine with each day seems to fade more and more. Gentry is a collector of old floppy discs which are being donated to him for production. The artist starts from the selection of labels on the discs which are suggesting what kind of information is stored on them. During the process, Gentry focuses on recycling obsolete media and the reuse of personal objects. Each floppy disk has a history of its own and represents the transformation of the modern life cycle, where objects are created, used and disposed of quicker than ever. Since these personal artifacts of life are cast aside and forgotten, they are given new life and a renewed purpose. So by employing discarded material, the artist documents historical media which once had a crucial role in modern technology and has outlasted its purpose. In his portraits and installations, the human form is the means to explore the medium, not a subject in itself. Apparent fascination with the futuristic and cybernetic narrative makes the art of Nick Gentry focused on the relationship of the humans to both man-made world and reality. That is related with the notions of life and death in regards to constant technological development. The human figure becomes a hybrid respectively cyborg, a bettered entity made out of human and machine. Yet, it seems as if those cyborgs got stuck in the void. The monochrome surface behind them undermines that actually (technological) consumerism implies nothingness and desperate attempt of adaptation.
