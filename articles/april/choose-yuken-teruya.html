                <p class="text-article">
                    Yuken Teruya was born in Okinawa, Japan in 1973. Yuken received his BFA from Tama Art University, Tokyo in 1996, and his MFA from the School of Visual Arts, New York in 2001. 
                    He has shown at the Guggenheim, New York, the Biennale of Sydney, Greater New York 2005 at MoMA PS.1, Shanghai Biennale, Saatchi Gallery London, Moscow Biennale, Yokohama Triennale, the US Ambassador's House, Tokyo, 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan, and in various other exhibitions in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
                    His work is included in the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Guggenheim, New York; Flag Art Foundation, New York; the Charles Saatchi Collection, London; Ethnological Museum/Asian Art Museum Berlin, 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan; and the Mori Art Museum, Japan, among others.
                    Yuken Teruya is as artist based in New York and Berlin who uses toilet paper rolls, shopping bags, and common paper in works that reflect the life, history, and untouched nature of his homeland Okinawa. He takes a modern twist on the ancient Japanese art of Kirigami, a form of origami where the paper is cut instead of folded. Teruya cuts intricate tree shapes and pushes them through the interior of the bag, making an enclosed environment. Teruya has used lots of McDonald’s and designer bags in his art. 
                    At my house, we love to make art. My family and I sometimes spend entire days creating art, and there is always some sort of creative project in some stage of doneness on one or more surfaces in our home. We also enjoy experiencing other people’s art by going to museums and learning about different artists and their creative processes. My youngest daughter likes to rescue things from the recycling bin and create pieces of art with the materials. Her latest obsession has been toilet paper rolls. She has made butterflies, fish, gift containers and binoculars to name a few of the creations that have been born out of the toilet paper roll. I love that at 6 years old she can look beyond the intended purpose of a material and give it new life.
                    Imagine our delight when we found Yuken Teruya, an artist who was born in Japan and is now based in New York City. Teruya creates art out of things you might find in your recycling bin like — you guessed it — toilet paper rolls. Using tiny pointy scissors, Teruya cuts pieces from the toilet paper rolls and shapes them into incredibly beautiful branches, for example, and then stands the branches out from the roll. The hole where the branch was cut out of becomes part of the art and is made to look like a shadow of the branch. From the artist: “Toilet rolls sprouting and spreading branches are installed to a wall to create a forest. There is a moment when the cut-out branches and leaves start holding themselves up with their own strength. It is as if I am helping the paper awaken its ability to come to life.” Teruya also creates tiny charming sculptures from fast food bags and other disposable bags. These tiny sculptures show how we can recycle unlikely materials into lovely and sometimes profound works of art. For a look at some exquisite pieces Teruya did as a response to a natural disaster that ravaged Japan while the artist was visiting his homeland, visit Teruya’s website.
                    Yuken Teryua's work proves that discarded everyday objects can be re-invented into something elegant and beautiful. The Japanese artist crafts toilet paper rolls with a level of detail so that they adopt a new identity as delicately sculpted pieces -- reminiscent of columnar wind chimes intertwined in the branches of a tree. The Japanese artist has also used shopping bags and old pizza boxes in his collection of work that uses recycled materials to defy the defined roles of these objects.
