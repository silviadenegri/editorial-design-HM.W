                    In his portraits of collages, Derek Gores recycles magazines, labels, data and various analog and digital materials found to create works on canvas. The series presents the contrasting interests of Gores in the living beauty of the figure, aesthetic design angular design and abstract fashion and a sense of fearless play. His paintings are exhibited by galleries in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Sydney, Cologne, Miami, Santa Fe and more. Gores design customers include Dwell Magazine, Lincoln Motor Co., ESPN, Lenny Kravitz, Lucasfilm, Kings of Leon, U2, Adidas, Madonna, Harley Davidson, Standard Collective, National Football League, LiveNation, SEIU and more.
                    The graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design lives and works in Melbourne, Florida, exhibiting and healing with the audacious presented there, surrounded by the intelligence and culture of the space coast. Derek was honored to have his work selected for the Manifest Hope DC exhibition coinciding with the Presidential Inauguration in 2009 and in 2010 he was named "One of the 40 Great Artists of the New Contemporary Movement" Of an exhibition in London.
                    "I like that my images come only from small details, from the way the mind can not help but walk around, even if one tries to concentrate on one thing." In collages, some of the small pieces that I use are deliberate, but in most cases I trust randomly to help get a final result more interesting than expected.A friend calls it a "Zen Narrative."
                    His subjects are simply figures and objects in a space, influenced by the heroes Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Franz Kline, Rube Goldberg, Max Ernst and "those ancient old photos of Abraham Lincoln, where you can feel the whole minute The inside of each image. I love this buzz. I refer to a classical beauty, but made of raw and geometric parts and not designed. My real subject in figurative women is the study of "Fierce". Strength, Honesty, Vulnerability - I am admired with the greatest respect. I am not interested in heavy and conscious concepts, I do something simple and let the elements combine in the head, reacting to each story that the viewer brings to the table. When this goes well, I hope to create a real experience, instead of just an image of an experience. But it sounds a bit too big ... really I still hope this feeling of having a child's senses, where everything is new.
                    Floridian artist, designer and illustrator Derek Gores has become a master in the art of collage. He creates his works with shredded magazine paper, labels and other recycled materials. Gores starts by organizing his materials by color, and then creates images from them. His art, made from recycled materials, mostly depicts portraits of women or everyday life scenes inspired by the world of fashion and design. Although his works are a mosaic of various objects, they remain strikingly fluid and graceful.
                    Fashion is constantly reinventing itself while also drawing from the endless diversity of the past. Add in a constant stream of new ideas, and surprising trends are born. Derek Gores takes a similar approach. For his extraordinary collages, which quote from fashion photography, he uses mosaic pieces cut from different fashion magazines.
                    Gores takes – often literally – the written and illustrated out of context in order to express something new. Incredible faces and female figures emerge from the countless individual pieces. At the same time, every movement is perfectly recreated, every detail clearly recognisable. What sets his work apart is its esprit and liveliness.
                    For his collages, Derek Gores uses scraps of magazines, documents, logos, and found objects from the digital realm. The artist describes his technique as an intense emotional moment, in which he gives his creativity free reign. He connects memories and thoughts with smirking details, confidently affixing paper to canvas to make perfect artistic compositions. Creative vitality adheres to his art, making it irresistibly fascinating.
