                    ​​The Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn is certainly one of the most environmentally-conscious and invested artists, and received significant media attention for his work titled Support. Exhibited during the Venice Biennale, this piece of art wasn’t shown amid the others, but rather could be found in the Floating City’s central lane of transportation: the Grand Canal. Two child-like yet huge hands emerge from the water, to support the Ca’ Sagredo. A resounding message warning against the threat of climate change. 
                    One of the most talked-about artworks in Venice Biennale 2017 was the monumental sculpture that was created by a celebrated sculptor called Lorenzo Quinn.
                    Lorenzo Quinn was chosen by the United Nations Climate Change to create a 3-meter version of his monumental sculpture Support for the Climate Change Conference, COP25 in Madrid (2-13 December). The sculpture is a reminder of rising sea levels that threaten Venice and all coastal cities around the world. The installation, commissioned by Halcyon Art International and first unveiled by Quinn at the Venice Biennale in 2017, shows two hands emerging from the Grand Canal in Venice to protect and support the historical building of the Ca’ Sagredo Hotel. The 3-meter-high version of the installation is being brought to COP25 in Madrid to raise awareness for climate change and illustrate humanity’s capacity to damage the environment but also its ability to save it. 
                    He calls his work Support, which involves two giant hands rising from a canal to support the building that houses Ca’ Sagredo Hotel. The idea is to depict that the sculpture is helping Venice. It also symbolizes humankind’s capability to destroy the world and an equal ability to save the world too.
                    Venice, known for its canals, gondolas, and centuries-old bridges, has an intimate relationship with the water around it. The sculpture that was made in time for the 57th International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale showcases the threat of global warming and its impact on the relationship between the city and the water. Cities like Venice are faced with the threat of rising water levels from global warming.
                    The sculpture also calls for swift action in mitigating the effects of global warming. It reminds humanity that it has the power to make and destroy the world that it is and can use its capacities to deal with pressing issues.
                    Quinn partnered with Halcyon Gallery in London to create the sculpture in his studio in Barcelona using a classic method called lost-wax casting. The process involves making a mold created from a wax model of the design. This method has been used for several centuries around the world.
