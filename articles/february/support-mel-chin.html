                    Aiming to bring awareness to social and environmental issues, Mel Chin creates conceptual art that defies categories and labels. Chin’s investigative and expressive art includes collage, installations, animation, videos, and sculptures that engage in cross collaboration. In his ongoing “Revival Field” series (1989–present), works like Revival Field plant and field Study (aka Carulescens Cross) (2015) use special plants to remove toxins from polluted soil. In collaboration with a retired USDA agronomist, the series made Chin a pioneer in the “green remediation” approach to promoting viable environmental solutions to industrial waste contamination. The recipient of numerous awards, including the MacArthur Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and the Biennial Valiente Award from Voices Breaking Boundaries, Chin has been featured in the PBS program Art of the 21st Century. His work can be found in the collections of the Columbus Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
                    Like many of the artists on this list, Mel Chin has a conceptual practice that seems to know no bounds. His earliest environmental work is Revival Field, an ongoing project that began in 1991. In it, Chin utilizes specific plants to extract heavy metals from contaminated soil at a Superfund site in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Developed in collaboration with since-retired USDA senior research agronomist Dr. Rufus Chaney, Revival Field helped pioneer and validate the practice of “green remediation”—a holistic approach that ensures environmental solutions to industrial waste are as sustainable as possible. 
                    Chin compared his approach to Revival Field to a sculptor carving away at marble. He once told Art21, “If [pollution] could be carved away, and life could return to that soil and then a diverse and ecologically balanced life, then that is a wonderful sculpture. But we have to create the chisels, and we have to create the tools, and we have to isolate the problem: where the block of pollution is, so we can carve it away.”
                    By 1993, Chin and Dr. Chaney were able to successfully conclude the first phase of Revival Field. The plants had successfully absorbed high levels of cadmium from the soil into its leaves and stems, creating a low-tech and environmentally sustainable alternative to artificial remediation methods. 
                    Another ongoing project, Operation Paydirt (2006–present), invites community members to express and actualize a future free of lead poisoning. By drawing their own versions of hundred-dollar bills—what Chin has termed “fundreds”—citizens assert the value of their voices when it comes to their local environments. Meanwhile, his most recent project Unmoored (2018) utilized augmented reality to allow people to visualize what Times Square might look like should global warming continue its course. Floating amidst oversized plankton under a canopy of boats, the piece asks its audience: “How will you rise?”
