                    Olafur Eliasson is a Danish-Icelandic contemporary artist born in 1967 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Eliasson works in many mediums, but he is widely known for his installation art. By playing with simple elements like light, water, and mirrors, the artist creates mesmerizing visual effects. Eliasson often mixes science, technology, and art when creating his pieces. His Studio in Berlin was established in 1995 and now holds 90 employees. 
                    Twelve large blocks of ice cast off from the Greenland ice sheet are harvested from a fjord outside Nuuk and presented in a clock formation in a prominent public place. The work by Olafur Eliasson and Minik Rosing raises awareness of climate change by providing a direct and tangible experience of the reality of melting arctic ice. Ice Watch has been installed in three locations. 
                    Ice Watch is the name of the installation by  Olafur Eliasson , an Icelandic artist born in 1967, who decided to invade the banks of the Thames in front of the Tate Modern with huge blocks of ice. The installation forms the shape of a clock face that constantly reminds us that we only have 12 years left to try to reduce the devastating effects of global warming.
                    In the center of the City, outside the Bloomberg European offices, another smaller installation was placed, signed by six blocks: this work is the result of the collaboration between Eliasson and the geologist Minik Rosing and debuted in conjunction with the opening of the work of COP24, the conference on climate change in Katowice, Poland.
                    This artwork was known as Ice Watch because he wanted the people to watch ice as it melted in public. It was a temporary installation that was meant to serve as an explanation and a reminder of the impacts of climate change.
                    Eliasson believed that the ice was beautiful, and you can smell it, touch it, and essentially lay your hands on it to witness the cooling and the melting. Touching the ice is like touching Greenland, making people have an emotional connection with the environment.
