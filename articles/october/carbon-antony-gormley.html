                    “For me and my studio team, an economy of means—in regard to energy, water and all the materials necessary for making the work—is a serious concern. Together, we continue to interrogate all our old ways of doing things to discover new avenues for reducing our carbon footprint. We use recycled car brake discs as the raw material for cast-iron works and renewable energy to smelt them, the roofs of our studio buildings are solar panelled, we are planting trees and reducing our air travel, we ship work by boat and assess the potential harmful impact of each and every project we are asked to consider.
                    The UK sculptor Antony Gormley has highlighted the taboo subject of the art world’s carbon footprint, raising the issue of art fairs’ impact on the climate crisis. In an interview with the Sunday Times, marking his forthcoming survey at the Royal Academy of Arts in London (21 September-3 December), Gormley discusses the Tate’s recent climate emergency pledge when its officials committed to reducing the institution’s footprint by ten per cent over the next four years. Gormley says that “we’ve got a very short amount of time to do a really huge amount of work”. The art world, he adds, “has to inquire into its own means. There’s no question that the art fair is [up there] along with probably the arms industry.” In a recent conversation with the artist Jeremy Deller, Gormley says both had mapped “the routes and the prevalence of arms fairs and art fairs”. We asked Deller if he equates art fairs with arms fairs. The Turner prizewinner tells us: “No. Though arms dealers do buy art. But I think he [Gormley] was getting ahead of himself.”
                    Gormley adds in the interview that “art fairs serve a minute proportion of the world’s population, and just the export and import and packing, and transport of all the works, and then you add to that all the air fares of all the people who go to them, and there’s no question this is a profligate use of resources.” Asked if he stands apart from this, he says, “No, I’ve been absolutely hook, line and sinkered by it!” Gormley declined to comment further.
