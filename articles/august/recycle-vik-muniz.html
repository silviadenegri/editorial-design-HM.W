                <p class="text-article">
                    Vik Muniz is a contemporary artist from Brazil born in 1961 in São Paulo. He currently lives in New York.
                    A child from poor neighborhoods, he discovered art in books he borrowed from the library and obtained a scholarship to attend evening classes.
                    One day, he witnesses a settling of scores in the street. Wounded by gunshot, he is offered a sum of money by the aggressor to preserve his silence. It was with this money in his pocket that he decided to move to Chicago, then to New York. He settled in Brooklyn and went on several jobs before joining a workshop. He then began his artistic activity with sculpture .
                    Vik Muniz definitely embarked on an artistic career in the early 1980s. Very quickly, he created a recognizable personal style for himself. The artist reuses waste and low-tech elements to create clean works, or reinvest in art classics. Dust, cigarette ends, puzzle, magnets, toys… Muniz is capable of transforming any material into a medium. He then takes a photograph of the assembled work. The illusion of the image disconcerts the spectators. Through his work, Muniz invites us to take a different look at familiar masterpieces in which he has inserted elements of everyday life.
                    Thanks to this approach, he obtained international recognition in 1997 with the series of paintings “Pictures of Chocolate", painted in chocolate. The Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA) then offered him his first exhibition. He repeated the feat in 2006 with the series “Pictures of Junk", this time made from garbage from our daily life as consumers and thus confirms its anchoring on the world contemporary art scene.
                    In the 2000s, he moved to Rio de Janeiro and worked for three years with residents living near one of the largest landfills in the world. They collect garbage for him which he will use to create works of art. He is filmed in his approach by Lucy Walker who will sign the documentary "Waste Land" in 2010, relating this adventure. The sale of these works at Sotheby's in London made it possible to redistribute the money earned - around € 250,000 - to the Brazilian community in question.
                    His work is exhibited all over the world, in renowned cultural institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA in New York, the European House of Photography in Paris or at the Tate Modern in London.
                    Brazilian artist Vik Muniz is central to the recycled art movement. Discovered by an art dealer in New York in the mid-1980s, he specializes in reproducing masterpieces with recycled materials. His materials range from trash, to shredded magazines, wires, puzzle pieces and even dust. Muniz creates large-scale pieces, whose compositions require them to be digitally projected onto the ground from a height. The documentary “Waste Land” focuses on Muniz’s project Jardim Gramacho in Rio de Janeiro, which took place over three years in the world’s biggest wasteland.
                    For this project, Vik Muniz worked with “pickers” who collected waste for the artist and his recycled art projects. The pickers then assembled the pieces into sculptures, which were projected onto the floor inside a warehouse. At the end of the project, the artist sold all the photographs during an auction event, and donated the proceeds to the pickers who participated to the project.
                    Vik Muniz proves the true power of “trash”
                    ‘The unlikely union of the two media I prefer is what gives my work a contemporary character,’ according to Muniz. Although the overall atmosphere of his work is very surprising and – at times – thought-provoking.
                    The raw materials he uses in abundance are most often recognisable objects you can find in an every-day household. This grants his creations a strong narrative impact. The various shapes, sizes and textures collected in every piece tell an elaborate story.
                    A lot of his most celebrated pieces are based on famous artworks themselves. Take his tasty interpretation of Leonardo da Vinci’s ‘Mona Lisa’, for example, which is made entirely of peanut butter and strawberry jam. Another one is Andy Warhol’s portrait of Marilyn Monroe, Muniz ‘painted’ with chocolate sauce.
                    ‘On the whole, I prefer to work on a very low–tech level because there’s something quite redeeming in using the barest mechanics to produce an image,’ says Muniz. Lately, he’s been working predominantly with landfill materials, having completed series such as ‘Pictures of Junk’ and ‘Pictures of Garbage’ in recent years. 
                    Using trash in a creative process seems a perfect fit for the artist. ‘The beautiful thing about garbage is that it’s negative; it’s something that you don’t use any more; and, moreover, it’s something you don’t want to see any more,’ he says. ‘So, if you are a visual artist, it becomes a very interesting material to work with because you are basically working with something that you usually try to hide.’
                    No matter what materials he uses, whether it is rubbish or sweets, the result is always something quite inventive. It’s fair to assume Muniz probably slaves over every detail to get each individual screw, speck of dirt and candy wrapper in the right position. Still he maintains that the appearance of spontaneity is absolutely vital to him. 
                    ‘Above all, I want to create the illusion that my work happened “by accident”,’ he says. ‘However, I don’t want to amaze the audience with my powers to fool them. I have been called an illusionist, but I have, in fact, always considered myself a twisted kind of realist.’
