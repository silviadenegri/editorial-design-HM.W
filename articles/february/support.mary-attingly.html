                    Through photography, sculpture, installation, and performance, Mary Mattingly imagines a dire post-apocalyptic future. In Mattingly’s imagination, humans are forced to live nomadically, scavenging the wreckage of civilization and living by their wits. She imagines (and sometimes develops) unique transportation solutions for her subjects, such as the Personal Flight Machine (2007) and Kart (2008), a shelter built on a bike In 2008, she also created the Waterpod™, an alternative living model that consisted of a movable, floating barge that could adapt to changing sea levels.Though Mary Mattingly’s artistic practice is expansive—traversing photography, sculpture, installation, and performance—she is arguably best known for Swale, a barge–turned–floating edible landscape that launched in New York in 2016. Open to the public, the ongoing public art piece and vigilante garden invites communities to pick their own produce, addressing the city’s food deserts and reconnecting neighbors with local ecologies. 
                    By situating Swale on the water, Mattingly was able to ingeniously circumvent a New York City law that makes it illegal to grow or pick food on public land. “I grew up in an agricultural town outside of NYC where the drinking water was polluted,” Mattingly stated on her website. “That framed my understanding of clean water as an increasingly rare resource that needed to be protected. Swale came out of a need to connect with and rely upon New York’s waterways and public land in order to better care for it, and by proximity, each other.”
                    The project gained so much momentum that in less than a year after launching, a New York City Parks commissioner opened its own public edible garden in Concrete Plant Park in the Bronx. Currently under consideration as a pilot program, the initiative is the first time New York City Parks is allowing people to publicly forage in almost 100 years.
                    Mattingly’s other works similarly interrogate the systemic and political frameworks impacting our relationship to the environment. In a 2018 commission for Brooklyn’s BRIC titled What Happens After?, the artist disassembled a military vehicle, tracing it back to its most fundamental mineral elements. In doing so, Mattingly exposed exploitative strip mining practices, highlighting the unseen environmental consequences of war. Meanwhile, her most recent project, The Ecotopian Library (2020), asks people around the world to contribute to a collective toolkit that will help create better futures out of a climate-changed world.
